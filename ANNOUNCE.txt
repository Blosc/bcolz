Announcing carray 0.5
=====================

What's new
----------

carray 0.5 supports completely transparent storage on-disk in addition
to memory.  That means that *everything* that can be done with the
in-memory container can be done using the disk instead.

The advantages of a disk-based container is that the addressable space
is much larger than just your available memory.  Also, as carray is
based on a chunked and compressed data layout based on the super-fast
Blosc compression library, the data access speed is very good.

The format chosen for the persistence layer is based on the 'bloscpack'
library (thanks to Valentin Haenel for his inspiration) and described in
'persistence.rst', although not everything has been implemented yet.
You may want to contribute by proposing enhancements to it.  See:
https://github.com/FrancescAlted/carray/wiki/PersistenceProposal

Moreover, a new `attrs` accessor is provided, so that users can store
its own metadata (in a persistent way, if desired).

CAVEAT: The bloscpack format is still evolving, so don't trust on
forward compatibility of the format, at least until 1.0, where the
internal format will be declared frozen.

Also, many bugs have been fixed, providing a much smoother experience.

What it is
----------

carray is a chunked container for numerical data.  Chunking allows for
efficient enlarging/shrinking of data container.  In addition, it can
also be compressed for reducing memory/disk needs.  The compression
process is carried out internally by Blosc, a high-performance
compressor that is optimized for binary data.

carray can use numexpr internally so as to accelerate many vector and
query operations (although it can use pure NumPy for doing so too).
numexpr can use optimize the memory usage and use several cores for
doing the computations, so it is blazing fast.  Moreover, with the
introduction of a carray/ctable disk-based container (in version 0.5),
it can be used for seamlessly performing out-of-core computations.

carray comes with an exhaustive test suite and fully supports both
32-bit and 64-bit platforms.  Also, it is typically tested on both UNIX
and Windows operating systems.
