What it is
==========

carray is a chunked container for numerical data.  Chunking allows for
efficient enlarging/shrinking of data container.  In addition, it can
also be compressed for reducing memory needs.  The compression process
is carried out internally by Blosc, a high-performance compressor that
is optimized for binary data.

carray comes with an exhaustive test suite and fully supports both
32-bit and 64-bit platforms.  Also, it is typically tested on both UNIX
and Windows operating systems.
