Release notes for carray
========================

Changes from 0.3.1 to 0.3.2
===========================

- New `vm` parameter for `eval()` that allows to choose a 'python' or
  'numexpr' virtual machine during operations.  If numexpr is not
  detected, the default will be 'python'.

  That means that you can use any function available in Python for
  evaluating carray expressions and that numexpr is not necessary
  anymore for using `eval()`.

- New `out_flavor` parameter for `eval()` that allows to choose the
  output type.  It can be 'carray' or 'numpy'.

- New `defaults.py` module that enables the user to modify the defaults
  for internal carray operation.  Defaults that are currently
  implemented: `eval_out_flavor` and `eval_vm`.

- Fixed a bug with `carray.sum()` for multidimensional types.


Changes from 0.3 to 0.3.1
=========================

- Added a `limit` parameter to `iter`, `where` and `wheretrue` iterators
  of carray object and to `iter` and `where` of ctable object.

- Full support for multidimensional carrays.  All types are supported,
  except the 'object' type (that applies to unidimensional carrays too).

- Added a new `reshape()` for reshaping to new (multidimensional)
  carrays.  This supports the same functionality than `reshape()` in
  NumPy.

- The behaviour of a carray was altered after using an iterator.  This
  has been fixed.  Thanks to Han Genuit for reporting.


Changes from 0.2 to 0.3
=======================

- Added a new `ctable` class that implements a compressed, column-wise
  table.

- New `arange()` constructor for quickly building carray objects (this
  method is much faster than using `fromiter()`).

- New `zeros()` constructor for quickly building zeroed carray objects.
  This is way faster than its NumPy counterpart.

- New `ones()` constructor for quickly building 1's carray objects.
  Very fast.

- New `fill()` constructor for quickly building carray objects with a
  filling value.  This is very fast too.

- New `trim()` method for `carray` and `ctable` objects for trimming
  items.

- New `resize()` method for `carray` and `ctable` objects for resizing
  lengths.

- New `test()` function that runs the complete test suite.

- Added a new `eval()` function to evaluate expressions including any
  combination of carrays, ndarrays, sequences or scalars.  Requires
  Numexpr being installed.

- Added new `__len__()` and `__sizeof__()` special methods for both
  `carray` and `ctable` objects.

- New `sum()` method for `carray` that computes the sum of the array
  elements.

- Added new `nbytes` and `cbytes` properties for `carray` and `ctable`
  objects.  The former accounts for the size of the original
  (non-compressed) object, and the later for the actual compressed
  object.

- New algorithm for computing an optimal chunk size for carrays based on
  the new `expectedlen` argument.

- Added `chunklen` property for `carray` that allows querying the chunk
  length (in rows) for the internal I/O buffer.

- Added a new `append(rows)` method to `ctable` class.

- Added a new `wheretrue()` iterator for `carray` that returns the
  indices for true values (only valid for boolean arrays).

- Added a new `where(boolarr)` iterator for `carray` that returns the
  values where `boolarr` is true.

- New idiom ``carray[boolarr]`` that returns the values where `boolarr`
  is true.

- New idiom ``ctable[boolarr]`` that returns the rows where `boolarr` is
  true.

- Added a new `eval()` method for `ctable` that is able to evaluate
  expressions with columns.  It needs numexpr to be installed.

- New idiom ``ctable[boolexpr]`` that returns the rows fulfilling the
  boolean expression.  Needs numexpr.

- Added fancy indexing (as a list of integers) support to `carray` and
  `ctable`.

- Added `copy(clevel, shuffle)` method to both `carray` and `ctable`
  objects.

- Removed the `toarray()` method in `carray` as this was equivalent to
  ``carray[:]`` idiom.

- Renamed `setBloscMaxThreads()` to `blosc_set_num_threads()` and
  `whichLibVersion()` to `blosc_version()` to follow carray name
  conventions more closely.

- Added a new `set_num_threads()` to set the number of threads in both
  Blosc and Numexpr (if available).

- New `fromiter()` constructor for creating `carray` objects from
  iterators.  It follows the NumPy API convention.

- New `cparams(clevel=5, shuffle=True)` class to host all params related
  with compression.

- Added more indexing support for `carray.__getitem__()`.  All indexing
  modes present in NumPy are supported now, including fancy indexing.
  The only exception are negative steps in ``carray[start:stop:-step]``.

- Added support for `carray.__setitem__()`.  All indexing modes present
  in NumPy are supported, including fancy indexing.  The only exception
  are negative steps in ``carray[start:stop:-step] = values``.

- Added support for `ctable.__setitem__()`.  All indexing modes present
  in NumPy are supported, including fancy indexing.  The only exception
  are negative steps in ``ctable[start:stop:-step] = values``.

- Added new `ctable.__iter__()`, `ctable.iter()` and `ctable.where()`
  iterators mimicking the functionality in carray object.


Changes from 0.1 to 0.2
=======================

- Added a couple of iterators for carray: `__iter__()` and `iter(start,
  stop, step)`.  The difference is that the later does accept slices.

- Added a `__len__()` method.
